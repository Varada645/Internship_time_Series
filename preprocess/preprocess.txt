## üìù **Preprocessing Report**

### **1. Actions Performed**

- **Dropped Redundant Column:**  
  - Removed `Reporting Area` as it was not needed.

- **Missing Data Analysis:**  
  - Calculated missing counts and percentages for `Dengue`, `HepatitisC`, and `Lyme disease`.

- **Duplicate Handling:**  
  - Checked for duplicate dates (found 2).
  - Aggregated duplicates by summing case counts.

- **Date Handling:**  
  - Created a proper `Date` column from `Year` and `Week`.
  - Ensured all rows have a valid weekly date.

- **Imputation of Missing Values:**  
  - **Dengue:** Filled missing values with 0 (since most weeks have 0 cases).
  - **HepatitisC:** Imputed missing values using the monthly mean.
  - **Lyme disease:** Imputed missing values using the monthly mean from 2006‚Äì2016.

- **Data Type Enforcement:**  
  - Rounded imputed values and converted them to integers.

- **Added Time Features:**  
  - Ensured `Date`, `Month`, and `WeekOfYear` columns are present and adjacent.

- **Set Weekly Frequency:**  
  - Set the DataFrame to have a weekly frequency (`W-MON`), forward-filling as needed.

- **Validation:**  
  - Checked that all missing values for the three diseases are now filled.

- **Saved Output:**  
  - Exported the cleaned DataFrame to `preprocessed_dataset.csv`.

### **2. Output Summary**

#### **Missing Data (Before Imputation):**
- **Dengue:** 209 missing (~28.6%)
- **HepatitisC:** 209 missing (~28.6%)
- **Lyme disease:** 156 missing (~21.4%)

#### **Duplicates:**
- 2 duplicate dates found and aggregated.

#### **Missing Data (After Imputation):**
- **Dengue:** 0 missing
- **HepatitisC:** 0 missing
- **Lyme disease:** 0 missing

#### **Descriptive Stats (After Preprocessing):**
- Provided for `Dengue`, `HepatitisC`, and `Lyme disease` (mean, std, min, max, etc.)

#### **CSV Output:**
- The file `preprocessed_dataset.csv` contains:
  - Cleaned and imputed data.
  - Columns: `Date`, `Month`, `WeekOfYear`, `Year`, `Week`, and all disease columns.
  - No missing values for the three key diseases.
  - Weekly frequency, ready for time series analysis or modeling.

### **3. Key Improvements**

- **Data is now clean, complete, and consistent.**
- **Ready for analysis, visualization, or machine learning.**
- **No missing or duplicate dates.**
- **Temporal features (`Month`, `WeekOfYear`) are included for seasonality analysis.**
