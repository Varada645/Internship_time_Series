This script (`program_5_arima_model.py`) automates ARIMA time series modeling for disease case data. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what it does:

---

### 1. **Imports and Setup**
- Imports libraries for data handling (`pandas`, `numpy`), ARIMA modeling (`pmdarima`), plotting (`matplotlib`), and evaluation (`sklearn`).
- Sets up directory paths for input data, stationarity results, ARIMA outputs, and plots.
- Ensures output directories exist.

---

### 2. **Diseases List**
- Specifies which diseases to process (e.g., `'Giardiasis'`, `'chickenpox'`).

---

### 3. **Diagnostic Plot Function**
- `plot_diagnostics`: Plots the original series, its differenced versions, and their autocorrelation (ACF) plots to help diagnose time series properties.

---

### 4. **Main Loop (For Each Disease)**
For each disease:
- **Loads train/test CSVs** and stationarity results (recommended differencing order `d`).
- **Checks for missing/negative values** in the data.
- **Plots diagnostics** for the training data.
- **Applies log transformation** to stabilize variance.
- **Fits an ARIMA model** using `auto_arima` (automatically selects best ARIMA order).
- **Forecasts future values** (in log space, then reverses the log transform).
- **Calculates RMSE** (root mean squared error) between forecast and actual test data.
- **Saves results**: RMSE, ARIMA order, differencing order, forecast values, and plots (forecast, residuals).
- **Handles errors** gracefully and prints warnings if files are missing or if modeling fails.

---

### 5. **Outputs**
- Text files with ARIMA results.
- CSVs with forecasted values.
- Plots for diagnostics, forecasts, and residuals.

---

### **Summary**
This script automates ARIMA modeling for multiple diseases, including data validation, diagnostics, model fitting, forecasting, evaluation, and result saving. It is useful for time series forecasting of disease cases.


What is ARIMA?
ARIMA is a popular method for forecasting time series data (like disease cases over time). It stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.

What does auto_arima do?
auto_arima is a function that automatically finds the best ARIMA model for your data by trying different combinations of
