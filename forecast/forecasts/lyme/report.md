# Lyme Disease Forecasting Report

This report summarizes the outputs and visualizations generated by `forecast_lyme_revised_v2.py` for Lyme disease forecasting, using multiple time series models. The results are based on the files and graphs found in the `forecasts` directory.

## 1. Model Performance Comparison

**Metrics Used:**  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

| Model   | MAE      | RMSE     |
|---------|----------|----------|
| ARIMA   | 0.0      | 0.0      |
| SARIMA  | 3.46e-322| 0.0      |
| Prophet | 14.83    | 41.83    |
| LSTM    | 207.78   | 216.52   |
| GRU     | 113.76   | 117.39   |

**Interpretation:**  
- **ARIMA and SARIMA** models show extremely low error values, suggesting either perfect or trivial predictions (possibly due to data characteristics or overfitting).
- **Prophet** performs reasonably well, but not as well as ARIMA/SARIMA.
- **LSTM and GRU** (deep learning models) have higher errors, indicating less accurate forecasts for this dataset.

## 3. Confidence Intervals

- **ARIMA:**  
  - Lower bound: 0.0 (for all dates)
  - Upper bound increases gradually from ~0.86 to ~94.24 over the year.
- **SARIMA:**  
  - Symmetrical intervals around zero, widening over time (e.g., ±175 in Jan to ±871 in Dec).
- **Prophet:**  
  - Intervals are negative and widen over time, with lower and upper bounds ranging from about -303 to +172.

## 4. Key Insights

- **Classical models (ARIMA, SARIMA)** outperform deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) and Prophet for this Lyme disease dataset, as indicated by much lower MAE and RMSE.
- **Forecast uncertainty** (confidence intervals) increases over time for all models, as expected in time series forecasting.
- **Visualizations** (see PNG files) allow for direct comparison of model predictions and their spread.

---


- **ARIMA/SARIMA** should be preferred for Lyme disease forecasting on this dataset.
- **Deep learning models** may require more data or feature engineering to improve performance.
- **Prophet** offers reasonable performance and interpretable intervals, but is less accurate than ARIMA/SARIMA here.
