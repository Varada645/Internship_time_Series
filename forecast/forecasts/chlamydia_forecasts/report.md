# Chlamydia Forecasting Report

This report summarizes the outputs and visualizations generated by [`forecast_chlamydia.py`](forecast/forecast_chlamydia.py) for Chlamydia case forecasting, using multiple time series models. The results are based on the files and graphs found in the [`chlamydia_forecasts`](forecasts/chlamydia_forecasts) directory.

## 1. Model Performance Comparison

**Metrics Used:**  
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

| Model   | MAE      | RMSE     |
|---------|----------|----------|
| ARIMA   | 1738.82  | 2291.08  |
| Prophet | 3375.49  | 3848.60  |
| LSTM    | 1278.02  | 2019.43  |
| GRU     | 1279.89  | 1899.40  |

**Interpretation:**  
- **LSTM and GRU** (deep learning models) achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE, indicating the most accurate forecasts for this dataset.
- **ARIMA** performed moderately well, better than Prophet but not as well as LSTM/GRU.
- **Prophet** had the highest errors, suggesting it is less suitable for this dataset.

## 3. Confidence Intervals

- **ARIMA:**  
  - Lower and upper bounds are provided for each forecasted week in [`arima_chlamydia_conf_intervals.csv`](forecasts/chlamydia_forecasts/arima_chlamydia_conf_intervals.csv).
  - Example (first and last week):  
    - 2019-01-07: 2438.79 – 10965.65  
    - 2019-12-30: 7467.18 – 17741.40

- **Prophet:**  
  - Lower and upper bounds are provided in [`prophet_chlamydia_conf_intervals.csv`](forecasts/chlamydia_forecasts/prophet_chlamydia_conf_intervals.csv).
  - Example (first and last week):  
    - 2019-01-07: 11054.31 – 17308.09  
    - 2019-12-30: 10744.70 – 16539.82

## 4. Key Insights

- **Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)** outperformed classical models (ARIMA, Prophet) for Chlamydia forecasting on this dataset.
- **Forecast uncertainty** (confidence intervals) is provided for ARIMA and Prophet, showing the range of possible values for each week.
- **Visualizations** allow for direct comparison of model predictions and their spread.

## 5. Recommendations

- **LSTM and GRU** should be preferred for Chlamydia forecasting on this dataset.
- **ARIMA** can be considered as a backup or for interpretability.
- **Prophet** is less accurate for this dataset and may not be suitable without further tuning.
