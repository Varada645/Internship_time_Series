Report on "Dengue Cases Over Time" Graph
Overview
The graph displays the weekly trend of Dengue cases in the United States from 2006 to 2020.
Key Observations
2006–2016:
Dengue cases are nearly absent, with almost all weeks reporting zero cases.
2017–2018:
Occasional, isolated spikes begin to appear, but the number of cases remains very low (typically 1–4 cases per week).
2019–2020:
There is a noticeable and sharp increase in Dengue cases.
The highest weekly count exceeds 16 cases.
The frequency and magnitude of spikes are much greater compared to previous years.
Interpretation
Emergence:
Dengue was not a significant public health issue in the US for most of the period, but recent years show a clear upward trend.
Outbreaks:
The sharp spikes in 2019–2020 may indicate localized outbreaks or increased reporting/surveillance.
Seasonality:
No clear seasonal pattern is visible, but the data is sparse.
Recommendations
Further Investigation:
Analyze the geographic distribution of these cases to identify outbreak locations.
Investigate possible causes for the recent increase (e.g., climate change, travel, vector expansion).
Public Health Action:
Enhance surveillance and preventive measures in areas showing increased Dengue activity.
Summary
Dengue cases in the US were rare until 2017, after which there is a clear upward trend, peaking in 2019–2020. This warrants further epidemiological investigation and public health attention.
