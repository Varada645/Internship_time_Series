Here’s what your missing data investigation means:

---

### **1. Missing Data Summary**
- **Dengue:** 209 missing values (out of 730 rows)
- **HepatitisC:** 209 missing values
- **Lyme disease:** 156 missing values

---

### **2. Missing Percentage**
- **Dengue & HepatitisC:** ~28.6% of the data is missing for each
- **Lyme disease:** ~21.4% missing

---

### **3. Missing Data by Year**
- **Dengue & HepatitisC:**  
  - All data is missing from 2006–2009 (52 or 53 weeks each year).
  - No missing data from 2010 onward.
- **Lyme disease:**  
  - No missing data until 2016.
  - All data is missing for 2017, 2018, and 2019 (52 weeks each year).

---

### **4. Missing Data by Reporting Area**
- All missing data is for the "United States" reporting area (the only area in your dataset).

---

### **5. Dengue Missing Periods (Sample)**
- The first few missing Dengue records are from the start of 2006 (weeks 1–5 shown).

---

### **6. Dengue Non-Missing Stats**
- **Count:** 521 non-missing values
- **Mean:** 0.26 cases per week (very low)
- **Std:** 1.35 (most weeks have 0 cases, but some spikes)
- **Max:** 16 cases in a week
- **Median (50%):** 0 (most weeks have 0 cases)

---

## **Interpretation**
- **Dengue & HepatitisC:**  
  - Not reported or not collected from 2006–2009. Data collection likely started in 2010.
- **Lyme disease:**  
  - Not reported or not collected from 2017–2019.
- **Most missing data is due to entire years not being reported, not random gaps.**
- **Dengue is a rare disease in this dataset, with most weeks reporting zero cases.**

---

**Summary:**  
The missing data is systematic (entire years), not random. This is likely due to changes in surveillance/reporting practices over time. For analysis, be cautious when comparing trends across years with and without missing data.
